==========

this is one of the first projects I ever made when I was learning development around 2013. it's not very useful but i keep it here for nostalgia. if i were to make something like this today i would just make it in vanilla js.

==========
this is a chess game meant to be played between 2 players that are using the same computer for taking turns, or through email correspondence via the share position link.

you can:

- take back one move.

- flip the board to see the other perspective.

- play on mobile (responsive css).

- share the board position by copying the auto generated link. look for the broadcast tower button.

- view score during the game. based on: k=0,q=9,r=5,b=3,n=3,p=1.

the game allows the chess pieces to move freely to any square just like a manual chess board. similarly, you are responsible for monitoring the legality of your opponent's moves.

the game uses php. therefore, if you host the files locally on your computer, you will need to download and run server software such as mamp, wamp or xampp while playing the game. to play via correspondence with the files locally hosted, both opponents' computers will need to host the files and run the server software on their computer.

alternatively, you can upload the files to a webhost and play online without the need for running server software or hosting the files on your computer.
